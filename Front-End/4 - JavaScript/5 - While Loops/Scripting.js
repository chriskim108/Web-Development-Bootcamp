
// These loops are the very similar to C++ 
// A while loop will keep on continuing on the loop while the condition is true
// Example 1
/*
var counter = 1;
while(counter < 6){
	console.log(counter);
 	counter++;
}
*/

//Example 2
/*
var word = "Hellllo";
var counter = 0;

while(counter < word.length){
	console.log(word[counter]);
	counter++;
}
*/
