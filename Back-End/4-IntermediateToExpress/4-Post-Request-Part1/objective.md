# Post Requests!!!
* Write post routes, and test them with Postman
    * Similar to the "get" command 
        * app.get("URL", function(){})
* Use a form to send a post request
* Use body parser to get form data
    * We had to install body-parser
    * We had to tell our app.js to use it

# Note
* We are going to make a friends app
    * We have a list of friends
    * Where we can go in through a form add a new friend to your list 
* res.redirect
    * Will take a URL ("/friend")
    * And it will trigger that route again
