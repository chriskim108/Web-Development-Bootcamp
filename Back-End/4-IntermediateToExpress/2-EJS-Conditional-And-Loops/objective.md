#EJS Control Flow


* Show examples of control flow in EJS Templates
    * 
* Write if-statements in an EJS file
    * We must take out the equal sign
    * Example:
        * <% %>
    * The reason why is because in the EJS, there are 3 different types of tags
    * The first 2 is:
        * <%= %>
            * When we need to evaluate something
        * <% %>
            * Logic or loops
* Write loops in an EJS file
    *
